# Introduction
The ATMEGA32-AVR microcontroller is widely used microcontroller in embedded systems development. This repository aims to provide a collection of custom drivers written in C for this microcontroller, making it easier to develop applications and interact with various peripherals.


# Features
- **Peripheral Drivers:** Custom drivers for commonly used peripherals such as DIO, UART, SPI, I2C, Timer, and more.
- **Hardware Abstraction:** The drivers provide a high-level abstraction layer, allowing for easier and more portable code development.
- **Efficiency:** Optimized code for efficient resource utilization and maximum performance.
- **Modularity:** Each driver is organized into separate files, making it easy to include only the required drivers in your project.
- **Documentation:** Detailed comments and documentation within the code for better understanding and usage

# Getting Started
To get started with using these drivers in your ATMEGA32-AVR project, follow these steps:
1. Clone or download this repository to your development environment.
2. Copy the required driver files from the repository to your project directory.
3. Include the necessary driver header files in your source code.
4. Configure the microcontroller's peripherals and initialize the drivers as needed.
5. Build and flash your project onto the ATMEGA32-AVR microcontroller.
